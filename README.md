# googleHomepage

A stylistic [duplicate](https://iraquint.github.io/googleHomepage/google.html) of the Google home page with CSS/HTML.

The project was started by following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dRqMeIy0_4&index=6&list=PLskZP4iE0XzaHE0yH2KUiPD-BMk-fIkHN), then changes were made to reflect the current Google home page as of August 2018.
